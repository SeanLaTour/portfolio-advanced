			  <h2>Who am I?</h2>
			  <p>All philisophical quandries aside, I am Sean La Tourette! I am a software developer living in San Diego, CA. When I am not coding websites, games and apps I'm playing my guitar or my bass. Like I say, if it comes with strings, I play them things! I also love surfing and archery, and when I feel like ramping down you can find me playing The Witcher or Zelda. I'm a very relaxed, easy going kind of guy and I do my best to not let the tough parts of life get to me. If there was one thing that I feel I was blessed with it was my creativity. I love to craft things, whether they be songs, video games or websites. It is my passion to create, and learning to develope has become the gift I have given myself. I use it to advance in all my other passions and promote myself. It is the magic that I have woven throughout my life. I just love watching things come to life!</p>

			  <h2>About Me</h2>
			  <p>I first became interested in web development when I came up with the idea to make a website for my band. Throughout the challenge of creating the band's website I realized how exciting it could be to watch my ideas come to life on the web. It was then I started taking steps towards a career in fullstack development. I always loved working with my bandmates and after talking to a few friends in the web development industry I discovered that it wasn't much different than playing music! I suppose you could now say that I'm searching for my own band of programmers to create some sweet applications with. I want to provide people with smooth, jazzy/R&B styled front-end webpages with the power of a nine piece metal band in the back-end! Every page I design will be a symphony of elegance and utility.</p>
