          <h2>Who am I?</h2>
          <p>
            I am Sean La Tourette! I am a
            software developer living in San Diego, CA. When I am not coding
            websites, games and apps I'm playing my guitar or my bass. 
            I first became interested in web development when I came up with the
            idea to make a website for my band. Throughout the challenge of
            creating the band's website I realized how exciting it could be to
            watch my ideas come to life on the web. It was then I started taking
            steps towards a career in fullstack development. I always loved
            working with my bandmates and after talking to a few friends in the
            web development industry I discovered that it wasn't much different
            than playing music! I suppose you could now say that I'm searching
            for my own band of programmers to create some sweet applications
            with. I want to provide people with smoothly styled
            front-end webpages with the power of a nine piece metal band in the
            back-end! Every page I design will be a symphony of elegance and
            utility.
